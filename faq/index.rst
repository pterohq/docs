What is a ‘MAU (Monthly Active User)’?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Monthly Active User (MAU) is any user of your application who triggered an event (that is tracked by Mixpanel) in the last 30 days. That is, to use Ptero you (currently) must be a Mixpanel user, so, any user who triggers an event you track using Mixpanel will count as an MAU.

Is Ptero free?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It sure is. If you have fewer than 25,000 MAUs, you can use all Ptero’s features -- including unlimited data storage, seats, and Scenarios -- for FREE. Once you exceed 25,000 MAUs (or if you have more than 25,000 MAUs at the time you register for Ptero) you will be entered into a 7-day free trial. At the end of the trial you will be prompted to pay for Ptero. 

How much does Ptero cost if I have more than 25,000 MAUs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It costs $25 to add another 25,000 MAUs to your Ptero account. So, if you have 90,000 MAUs the cost to you will be $75 per month. That is, 90,000 MAUs – 25,000 free MAUs = 65,000 MAUs. 3 “packs” of 25,000 MAUs will cover your MAU count in this case. Each “pack” is $25.

Do I have to pay for additional MAUs by credit card?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes. We can only accept credit card payments at this time.
 
How do I get my data into Ptero?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will need to be a Mixpanel customer. Once you register, simply follow the 3-step instructions to activate the integration of your Mixpanel data into Ptero. It takes under 24 hours for the largest of data sets to process. You will receive an email when your data and first set of results are ready.

Why do I need a Mixpanel account in order to use Ptero?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We chose to integrate with Mixpanel because it has a large user base and it is very simple to import data from Mixpanel. More integrations will be announced in the near future.
 
How do I cancel my paid subscription?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To stop paying for additional MAUs, visit your account page and select ‘Cancel Subscription’. You will not be billed in the next month’s billing cycle. You will still be able to view your analytics in “read only” mode, but you won’t be able to run additional scenarios.
