Ptero is priced based on the number of monthly active users (MAU) of your application. A Monthly Active User (MAU) is any user of your application who triggered an event in the last 30 days. To learn more, see our :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions <faq>` 



Free Plan
============================
Any company with fewer than 25,000 MAU will automatically be enrolled in the Ptero free plan. 

Free Trial
============================
If your application has more than 25,000 MAU, you will automatically begin your free *7 day free trial*. You will always get 7 days of free trial, even if you upgrade early.  

If you decide not to upgrade after your trial, you will not be able to run any additional scenarios or pull data. However, you will still be able to login and view your past scenario results. If you decide to upgrade in the future, you will be able to reactivate your account so that you don't lose any of your previous work. 

Paying Plan
============================
Ptero is priced based on the number of MAU for your application based on data we pull from Mixpanel. The first 25,000 MAU are free and each additional increment of 25,000 MAU is $25 per month. 

Billing for the Ptero paid plan occurs at the beginning of each 30 day period. 3 Days prior to your automatic renewal, we will send an email with your monthly amount due based on the number of MAU we've seen in the past 30 days. 


Cancellations
============================
You can cancel your Ptero account by sending an email to hi@pterohq.com. You will have full access through the end of your current 30 day pay period, after which you will have read only access.
